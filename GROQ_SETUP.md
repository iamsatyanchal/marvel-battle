# Marvel Battle Game - Groq AI Integration Setup

## Latest Updates

### Groq API Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The game now uses Groq AI to generate dynamic battle scenes with:
- **AI-Generated Battle Narratives**: Each battle is unique with custom scenes, dialogues, and outcomes
- **Dynamic Scene Titles**: Scene titles adjust their size based on content
- **Character Dialogues**: Each character speaks with their own dialogue bubbles (red for Character 1, blue for Character 2)
- **Real-time Health Updates**: Health bars update dynamically after each scene
- **Extended Scene Duration**: Each scene displays for 15-18 seconds (randomly varied)
- **Pollinations AI Image Generation**: Each scene prompt generates a unique comic-style image

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Get Groq API Key
1. Visit [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy your API key

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
1. Open the `.env` file in the root directory
2. Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key:
```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
```
